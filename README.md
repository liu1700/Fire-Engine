Fire-Engine
===========

Just want to create a game engine of my own, that's all

2014/1/8:
  Today is the first day of my own game engine, it's really simple one just like a cell.... 
  But,I will Make him a Great Engine ;ï¼‰
  
  1.Basic rendering without D3D(just a black window..);
  2.You can press 'ESC' to close the window;
  
2014/1/9:
  1.Render with D3D;
  2.Create&Write some simple messages to a .txt file;
  
2014/1/10:
  1.Render a simple colored polygon with shader;
  2.Little change in fileIO;
  
2014/1/11:
  1.Load a model's information from a .txt file and build it.
  2.Update the .ps & .vs file to render the model with lighting and map textures on the model
  3.Let the model roll!
  
2014/1/13:
  1.Render 2D images & 3D model on screen
  2.Draw text on the screen with FW1FontWrapper. It's really awful to code text rendering by myself, so I use the FW1FontWrapper, it does work. Remember to set the flags to FW1_NOGEOMETRYSHADER or you can't see other model.
  3.Working on DX input
  
  I really need to regroup my files, because it getting larger and larger!
  
2014/1/15:
  1.Render 25 cubes random both in color and position.
  2.We have frustum view, I'd like to call vision....
  3.We can use Left&Right keys to control our camera.
  4.Listening to music~~
  5.We can see the usage of CPU and FPS on our screen now.
  
2014/1/17:
  1.Most of the things are about Textures, MultiTextures, AlphaMapTexture, All of them works well on the 2D Rendering, but the render of 3D model is a mass..Debug it tomorrow!!!
  2.We can use Arrow Keys to look different directions now.
  3.Almost finish the creation of base classes(maybe something wrong happend when I code the base classes that make the 3D model wrong??)
  
  Tomorrow I have to find the bug of the rendering of 3D model
  
2014/1/17:
  It can render 3D model normally now. 
  I think, I need to stop adding anything new. I should stop and regroup my projects. Everyday I learn somrthing new and add it into my project. It's simple at the beginning but now it's different. It's becoming uncontrollable for me. Maybe I need to learn something about the Design of software project.
